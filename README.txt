# rpg-combat-durability
the github project for my repl.it project: "rpg combat durability"!

I made this project because I wanted to challenge myself to use python classes in a useful way! it became really fun to develope and eventually I added durability!
the original game didn't have durability, you can find that version in my repl.it profile (seamusDonahue) under the name rpg combat lite. I saw durability as a big
enough change that I forked the project to make this one
eventually I abandoned the old project and kept updating this!
thats when a repl user by the name of funnylamma joined me for developement (his current repl profile is called thewaydu). 
from there I just kept adding features untill we have what we have here, where I made a github for it!

#gameplay
--
in this game you can heal change weapon flee and attack during combat
then buy stuff in the shop between battles
#ac system
ac works like this:
 ac is a nubmer between 1 and 0 (being a decimal percentage.)
 if the enemy ac is bigger then your weapons ap, (in the code mislabeled as hitchance) the enemy will not take their ac percent of damage (so 0.5 would absord 50% damage)
 if the enemies ac is lower then your weapons ap, the enemy absorbs half of their ac in damage (so 0.5 will only absorb 25% of all damage)
these rules also apply to you
#levels
 you get xp every fight for winning (not for fleeing, coward!)
 when you level up your hp goes up along with your xp
 on top of that you get bonus gold depending on the level (lvl 1 gives 100, lvl 2 give 200 ect)
#food
food will heal you up to full hp during a fight (i do plan on updating this in the future so don't be suprised if this info becomes inaccurate)
everytime you goto the shop you may buy some!
everytime you buy food it goes up by half its cost (so 50 in half is 25 so the new price is 75)
#weapons and durability
all weapons do different damage, have different flavor text and have different durability
when durability runs out, your weapon breaks and you need to equip anew!
#tnt
tnt is a special kind of weapon.
it has 1 durability (referred to ingame as the ammount you have) and everytime you buy it, it gains a durability point
it does high damage but is expensive
#cheat codes
when naming yourself, you can name yourself many things that do stuff.
I call these cheat codes!
warning! achievement progress cannot be saved if you use cheats
oh you want me to tell you what they are? find out yourself ;)
#most importantly have fun!
