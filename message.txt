maybe we could get a few more on the team im not sure though
I original developed this alone and had not planned on making it a multiplayer project
lets also make achievements so there is a perpose to the database saving
one more thing, to make a new level you have to make more enemies then change the level up thing to higher max level what enemies you get is based on your level so if you dont add more it throws an error when it tries to pick level from list enemies.
added maxlevel variable to be what level you need to win!
-seamus


Good idea, i might work on some new enimies. I will try to find a way to make more levels without crashing. New creatures, giant skeleton, Phantom.-
-funnylamma

btw flee chance doesnt work for some reason, you always succeed your flee not sure why
nice job making more enemies
btw the phantom is weaker then a ghost, not sure if this is on perpose
-seamus

it was invalid syntax because the variable started with a number lol 
-seamus

btw if we make the angry elephant not the final boss, the maxhp has to be lowered to its hp to limit how much gold it gives you and so it doesnt have that much hp when its encountered again.
-seamus


Sorry, I was gone for a while on a vacation. I am back now though so i will work on it when I can. I made a new achievment too, mega killer, kill 1000 monsters. ANd a new weapon and enemy. I don't know how to put it into the game shop and use it in the game though, can you do that.
-funnylamma



Sorry that I had to unexpectedly go yesterday. Anyways im gonna start working on being able to get a critical. And also, it didnt save my progress.
-funnylamma


we need to overhaul the achivement system... It only saves pts so you can get the same achievement infinitely in infinite runs, and the system isnt really intiutive.
-seamus

Okay, i can work on that after school today.
-funnylamma

what if we store it in json?
example:
{
	"<playername>"{
		"achievement1":true,
		"achievement2":false,
		"achievement3":false
	}
	"<playername2>"{
		"achievement1":false,
		"achievement2":false,
		"achievement3":true,
	}
}
ect ect
we could then store what achievements have been done for what players. im not gonna start doing it until you respond. ofc you cant have an empty json file so the first bit of data would be something like: "dummy":null until we use it.
ofc we would also need an id for the objects as json wouldnt accept a python object, for that we just use the name of the achievement.
ps - we should probably clear this soon to save data, its not that big of a deal if you dont want to though, this file doesnt take up more than 100kb as of yet (its at 92kb currently)
-seamus



That is a very good idea, sorry i was busy yesterday. I had some unexpected homework to deal with. I can probably work on this today, but if i can't i definitly can tommarow. I delte the top few messages.
-funnylamma

awesome, ill start integrating json today after school/homework (or tommarow if need be)
glad to hear back from you.
ps- i said this file took up 92kb last time, I meant the repl as a whole takes up that ammount of space lol
-seamus

made saves connected to saves.json now (tested it with a kreeger save file (just a name i made up for a dnd character awhile back i like using)) a bit later ill make it so you can check your achievements in the shop.
-seamus


you may now check achievement progress in shop... if you want we can save other things too but at the same time if we save level that means that they wont be able to play the game so we should probably not save anything more
-seamus

I made save file entries have encoded names.
the encyption is very basic and easy to crack but the perpose was to make it so you can't delete someones savedata at first glance, you also wouldnt be able to use their savedata. you can see the code for that in encode.py

so to wrap this up basically your name (funnylamma) becomes gvoozmbnnb in saves.json, but when you type funnylamma in game it will fetch that savefile
-seamus

you can now change weapons in combat, I also made it so you can't save an cheat.
-seamus

from now on just check changelog.... not like you gonna be here anytime soon
-you probably know who...


I'm back, I had a rough weekend, and I couldn't use my computer, sorry. It looks like you added a lot of stuff. I can work quite often now, what should i work on though, new enimies? Again, i'm really sorry. Also i fixed a glitch with the new achievment.
-funnylamma

okay, I didnt mean for the "you probably know who..." to be as mean as it sounds to me now. anyways yea I added a lot... a lot. also what was wrong with the hardcore achivement did it just not function? also also if you are smarter then me and understand an actual encrypting library please help! the current one is made by me and kinda sucks. not entirely sure what im gonna add next! i have so many ideas like: 
-rings
	-buffs damage, ac ect but you can only equip one
-traps
	basically enemies that also damage themselves but you can also try to "disable them" (e.g. kill them because they are just self damaging enemies)
-theif
	a weak enemy that steals money when it attacks (about 20-30g?) and you can get 80% back when killing him.
-different types of food
	-steak
		heals like food does now but really expensive 
	-pork
		heals to 75% hp
	-stew
		heals 75% of lost hp
-and lastly enemy weakness and strengths
	e.g. zombies are weaker to swords and skeletons are more resistant to bows
what do you think?
-§eamus

That works for me, and I don't know how to encrypting libraray function either, sorry. The achievment had an issue, where the was a missing end parenthesis. Those are a lot of incredebly great ideas, and i really like the idea of rings, and traps. More types of food also should be pretty good too. I will start working on that later today. And also, maybe we should add armor. Can you also invite me as a collaberator to the github project. IM going to make a food class. Umm, also, the stick dealt 100 damage. I have some ideas too. Critical hits would be a good thing too add, and maybe also a systym that makes it so if you earn an acheivment, it gives you a permenent bonus on all games.
-funnylamma

crits are a good idea! and the repl isn't connected to a github. I don't know how to use it! your food class was using an argument variable that didn't exist (hprestore) but I replaced it with what i thought you meant (hp). I'd love to help add some of these features after school!

scratch what i said about git, I made a github, I donno how to add you yet! I also dont really know how it works but I guess ill have to learn... I think you can just push a version from the version controll tab under the files tab

-§eamus


So basiccly, here is a mini lesson on GitHub, sense I have issues linkng my github acount 
to my repl acout, your the one who can push, so when you finish an update or editing. You 
go to version controll, type a description, and hit the button that says push, this will update the work you did to github. In the tab bars at the topish of the screen, go over to settings and click it. You should be in a line of different settings. If you go down to the second setting in the list, right below options, you should now be in the manage acsess menu. The click on the button that says invite a collaborator. Then type FunnyLamma into the text box. Then select my name under the text box, then click the button that says,add FunnyLamma to this repository, then i will be a collaborator. Ps, please update the commits in the repl when you get back.
-funnyl@mma


I started the wiki on github. when you add something update the appropriate page. I am still adding pages so not everything is there yet. so far I have enemies and ac/ap
-§eamus

ever wonder if we need to give this game a proper name? not sure. also not sure how hard it would be to rebrand everything. also we probably should move saves to another repl, so that 
-§eamus

omg omg omg I have a big brain idea:
	we store saves in a .env so we dont have to encrypt them! (i just learned .env files are secret to those who do not own the repl).
so basically json.dumps() turns a string (that is in json format) into a python dictionary, so in theory this would be possible, but only if you can write to .env files also should we add audio to the game? if so I have some ideas on how to record files for the audio >:), audio however is still in beta so only explorers can use it (I am an explorer but idk if you are, and if you arn't idk if I can do it).
ps just looked it up, .env variables are constants so they can be written to, ignore my save file idea.
-§eamus


That is an amazing idea, that would work execlently, but i'm worried about how much space it would take up. BUt it  would be a good idea, and I think it will work pretty well, maybe it could be put in the 1.6 update?
-funnyl@mma

adding audio would bloat the gamesize i think but that all depends on how many sounds and their duration.
also idk what it is but it isn't functioning for me: https://repl.it/@SeamusDonahue/test-sound#main.py
-§eamus


IM sorry for kind of like taking over your game, you can update it how you want too.
-FunnyL@mma

your not taking it over at all, dont feel bad. I appriciate the help. sorry I wasnt on a lot today, my power was out. I hope you will keep working with me, either way the game will continue to update. the updates just might not be as often without you.
-§eamus

I will continue to help, and sorry about your power, it really sucks when my power goes out. And I will still help with updates on github and stuff.
-FunnyL@mma

Awesome, glad to have you on the team. Yea power outages suck. I will be off and on periodically because of my current situation with that.
